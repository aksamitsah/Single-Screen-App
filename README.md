### Functionality
  - Program must function in Android Studio emulator and on a phone. Upon launching on a phone, the card appears.
  -Layout scales responsively for screen sizes in portrait mode, with no part of any images only partially visible. Student is not responsible for responsive design in landscape mode.

### Note: Reviewers will test on a Nexus 5X which has a screen size of 5.2 inches (132.08mm). It is advised you test on this size at minimum. If your content does not fit on this size, consider implementing a ScrollView.

## Code Review
  - XML must include a Relative Layout, Linear Layout, or Constraint Layout
  - Must have one or more image views or text views.
  - Elements are specified in dp, text is specified in sp.
  - Good! You are now using sp for text sizes!
